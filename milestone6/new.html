            <p> Below are a few of my hand picked favorites that are new to the selkirk lineup! Check back often to see
                what else you can get!

            <div>
                <h2>Limited Edition Paddle: Gold Boomstik</h2>
                <p> The new BoomCore — PureFoam surrounded by an EVA Power Ring and fused together — is our most
                    powerful foam core system ever. Alongside a massive sweet spot, this core packs a powerful punch
                    with unrivaled durability. No core crush, no break-in period. Explosive power without compromise.
                </p>

                <h2>Limited Edition Paddle: Gold SLK Era</h2>
                <p> It’s designed with a new Dynamic Fusion Core — polypropylene honeycomb surrounded by closed-cell,
                    low-density EVA foam — which offers a stable feel with lasting durability. Its dwell time and spin
                    help you place the ball where you want it in the soft game, just before you flex its power for the
                    put-away.
