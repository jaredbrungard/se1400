            <img src="hero.png" alt="hero">
            <p> After completing a D1 Cross Country and Track Career, I found myself in a place without competitve
                sports. We then moved into an appartment complex that had one court and we gave it a try. Thirty minutes
                later I was hooked and wanting to find more and more competitive gamees. At the time I was working from
                home and doing online only school and it gave me a place to socialize and have a competitive spirt at
                the same time. Now, 5 years later that passion for the sport hasnt changed, my reason to play still the
                competive and social aspect, now its just at a low level professional level.
