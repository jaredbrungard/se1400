        <h2>The Target Audience</h2>

        <h4>Geolocation</h4>
        <p>The primary audience would be in the united states, however there is huge growth internationally as well. I
            would be marketing to the US
            markert fist, then expanding to other english speaking countries next</p>
        </p>
        <h4>Age</h4>
        <p>The age range would be from 18-65, as pickleball is a sport that is played by all ages.
            The main focus would be on the 30-50 year old range as they have the most expendable
            income. I would also consder seperate content for 50+ as the game chanes with age and
            athletism and could be like Silver Sneakers for pickleball</p>
        <h4>Gender</h4>

        <p>I would not be gender specific. It would more at sometimes explain a female/male role in mixed doubles, but
            the product
            is not marketed to one or the other</p>
