        <h2>Website Summary</h2>

        <h4>What content will the site contain?</h4>
        <p>The website will mostly contain information about pickleball videos and how to get better.
            It will go over different drills, and stragies and offer paid coaching services as well. There will
            also be an area to purchase products with my promo codes so they can save, and I can earn as well</p>

        <h4>Where will you get all of the content for your site?</h4>
        <p> I would get the main media from myself and the film I have. The when selling products from my sponsors I
            would get the images from
            them as I have permission to use them as a sponsered rep</p>
        </p>

        <h4>Why should users care about the focus of the site?</h4>
        <p>If they care enough about pickleball that they reached the site, it is for them. It is for improvements to
            their games, and
            to be able to get discounts on products they will be using anyway.
        </p>

        <h4>Why should a site be built for this?</h4>
        <p> It isnt for everybody, but the people that would use it crave it. It is the largest growning sport with
            millions playing for the first
            time each year, and this is a resouce to help them in their journey
        </p>

        <h4>What would you like users to do at your site?</h4>
        <p>Learn and trust the platform, from there, subscripe to paid lessons, and videos, as well as use my discounted
            page to earn myself income as well </p>

        <h4>What is the goal of the site?</h4>
        <p>As the owner the goal would to be making and income, as a user, to save money on gear, and learn and progress
            faster than they could on their own </p>
